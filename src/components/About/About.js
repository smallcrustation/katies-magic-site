        Four score and seven years ago*. Hello, I'm a full stack Javascript web
        developer using the PERN stack.
      </p>
      {/* <p>
        Growing up I had an affinity for computers that was sparked with video
        games(astonishing!). This lead me to find creative ways of getting
        things to work...
      </p>
      <p>
        Like when my parents turned off the internet and I 'borrowed' a
        neighbors WEP key with a netbook, linux, Aircrack-ng and a longggg
        ethernet cable through my window up to the roof where I was working on
        solving my 'Network Issues'.
      </p> */}

      <p>
        Before diving into web dev with JS, I took a few computer science
        classes in college then dabbled more with coding;{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        First with a small side scroller then web development with
        python/django, java/spring and then onto Javascript.
      </p>
